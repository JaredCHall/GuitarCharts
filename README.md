## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Deno](https://deno.land/) (v1.40+ recommended)

### Running Locally
```bash
git clone git@github.com:JaredCHall/GuitarCharts.git
cd GuitarCharts
deno task start
```
Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

### Building for Production
```bash
deno task build
```

## Project Structure

- `/islands` - Interactive components (CircleOfFifths, FingeringChart, etc.)
- `/classes` - Core TypeScript classes for scale logic and note finding
- `/routes` - Fresh routes and pages
- `/static` - Static assets (images, favicon)
- `/components` - Smaller UI components

## Philosophy

**GuitarCharts** was designed to feel like a musician's tool, not a math textbook. Minimalist, practical, and visually intuitive.

We believe that **understanding the fretboard visually** is the key to mastering guitar theory and improvisation.

## Roadmap

- ‚úÖ 1.0 Release: Basic CAGED scale visualization for key modes
- ‚è≥ Future Releases:
    - Chord charts (Major, Minor, 7th, Extensions)
    - Custom user scales
    - Advanced scale mode library (e.g., Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor)
    - Mobile-friendly optimizations
    - Save/share custom charts
